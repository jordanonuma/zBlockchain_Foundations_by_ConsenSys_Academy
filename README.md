# Final: Decentralized Price Feeds Especially Intended for Proof of Stake Tokens
### What is the business case, area, or topic that this use case applies to?

This set of smart contracts’ goal is to provide a metric for Proof of Stake token security by quantifying the value of the token identified by the market.

### What problem are you trying to solve? What is the value created by solving this problem?

Staking tokens are becoming increasingly used in design mechanism for dApp security. Security is gained by incurring a financial penalty to the user for deviant behavior larger than any financial reward possible, where deviant behavior is defined by the protocol.

Financial penalties are doled by slashing a fraction of, or in some cases the full amount, of collateral the user staked. Currently, this loss is either denominated in: 1) other tokens; 2) some fiat amount using an exchange API aggregator such as coinmarketcap.com; or 3) some combination of (1) and (2).

The problem with each of these methods are detailed as follows:
- Method (1) may not have a denomination of much relevance to the audience. As an exaggerated example, if you’re asked 0.1 units of unobtainiumorz for 1 ETH, this would be a slightly humorous joke but difficult sell for many reasons.
- Method (2) uses centralized sources that necessarily need to be trusted. Exchange agreggators such as coinmarketcap.com are heavily relied on, but because owners of these sites have privileged write access to these feeds (often for good maintenance reasons) these also become a central point of failure and security vulnerability subject to possible corruption from within or without.


### How will a blockchain be applied to this use case? Which component pieces will be utilized? Will the blockchain used be public, private, or consortium and why?

Blockchain application.

### How might a token be used for this use case? Why is it needed, and what benefit does it bring to the project? If a custom token isn't necessary, explain why.

New token, if applicable.

### Describe some other details and factors that are worth considering in this use case. Are there any difficulties or challenges that may have to be solved? Are there any weaknesses you could see that could be exploited? Feel free to ask your own question here, and provide an answer, if those questions aren't helpful.

Additional concerns and areas for future research.
